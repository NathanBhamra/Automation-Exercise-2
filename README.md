# Automation-Exercise-2
Automation Exercise 2

This project is for an Automation Exercise created by Nathan Bhamra.

When pulling the project, you must navigate to "src/test/java/org.searchjobs/runner/RunCucumberTest.java". When you run this java file, the script will run.
For a more detailed breakdown on the test, you can run the cucumber feature file at 'src/test/java/org.searchjobs/features/automationtestjobs.feature'.

This project will automate a user searching for an 'Automation Tester' job at LexisNexis. The script will navigate to the 'Search Jobs' page and search for the stated job.
If no jobs are available at the time, the script will fail.

To test that my script does work how intended, feel free to go into 'src/test/java/org.searchjobs/stepdefs/automationtestjobsStepDef.java' and change the string value on
line 107 to whatever you would like. Rebuild the project before running the test.

This is my first time using Java and over 2 years since programming, I hope this project sees you well. Any questions, feel free to Give Feedback.
